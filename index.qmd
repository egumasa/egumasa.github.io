I am a Research Assistant Professor at Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan. I received a PhD in Linguistics from University of Oregon. I also completed Quantitative Research Methods Specialization at the College of Education, University of Oregon.

My research centers on the assessment of second language spoken and written production using computational methods. My work draws on usage-based and functional approaches, as well as socio-cognitive theories of second language learning. I also work on developing and applying natural language processing tools that are tailored to specific needs in second language learning and assessment. I am also a strong advocate of Bayesian methods in (Instructed) Second Language Acquisition and assessment research. In my most recent publications, I have been increasingly relying on this analytic paradigm for its combination of flexibility, elegance and robustness in handling complex data structures. 

This is my new website I am building right now. Please visit [the old page here](https://masakieguchi.weebly.com) until I complete the migration.

This website is modeled on [Dr. Andew Heiss's website](https://www.andrewheiss.com/).
